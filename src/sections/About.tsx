          I&apos;m a CS and Math double major at UT Austin interested in cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, 
          and systems programming. Motivated by a strong sense of curiosity and excitement for exploring new
          unknowns, I&apos;m always looking for opportunities to challenge myself and learn.
